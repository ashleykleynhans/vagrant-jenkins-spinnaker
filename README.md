# vagrant-jenkins-spinnaker

> Supports Spinnaker v1.27.0 and higher, and Halyard v1.45.0 and higher.
Previous versions are not supported since their dependency packages are no longer
available to download after JFrog sunset Bintray on 1st May 2021.

Provision Jenkins and Spinnaker for CI/CD using Vagrant, Virtualbox and Ansible with the following configuration:

* 1 Jenkins box running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* 1 Spinnaker box running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

> The reason for Spinnaker running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is because the spinnaker-community repos
do not include sizes, and this causes issues when Halyard installs the spinnaker-igor
and spinnaker-clouddriver dependency packages, and Halyard does not complete the
installation process.

## Requirements

At least the following hardware resources will be required on the host machine that will be running the VirtualBox guest VMs:

| VM        | CPU | Memory |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| jenkins   |  2  | 2GB    |
| spinnaker |  2  | 6GB    |
|           |     |        |
| TOTAL     |  4  | 8GB    |
